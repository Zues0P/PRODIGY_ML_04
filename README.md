This is a Real Time Hand Gesture recognition model.
Which I have created using Mediapipe and Scikit-learn and OpenCV.
For time being i have only made the model to detect "4 Gestures" namely "A,B,C,L" .
This can futher be modified , i have used only four to understand and build a model that would help me learn and perform hand gesture recognition.
I have not used a dataset rather , i have created my own dataset , by collecting images and labeling them, and then training the model to recognize the image,and predict the output in realtime.
I have used RandomForest for this purpose.
